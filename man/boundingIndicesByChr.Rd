\title{Find indices of features bounding a set of chromosome ranges/genes, across chromosomes}
\usage{
boundingIndicesByChr(query, subject)
}
\arguments{
  \item{query}{GRanges or something coercible to GRanges}
  \item{subject}{GenomicRanges}
}
\value{
integer matrix with two columns corresponding to indices on
left and right bound of queries in subject
}
\description{
Finds subject ranges corresponding to a set of genes (query
ranges), taking chromosome into account. Specifically,
this function will find the indices of the features (first
and last) bounding the ends of a range/gene (start and
stop) such that first <= start < stop <= last. Equality is
necessary so that multiple conversions between indices and
genomic positions will not expand with each conversion.
Ranges/genes that are outside the range of feature positions
will be given the indices of the corresponding first or last
index on that chromosome, rather than 0 or n + 1 so that
genes can always be connected to some data. Checking the
left and right bound for equality will tell you when a query
is off the end of a chromosome.
}
\details{
This function uses some tricks from findIntervals, where
is for k queries and n features it is O(k * log(n))
generally and ~O(k) for sorted queries. Therefore will be
dramatically faster for sets of query genes that are sorted
by start position within each chromosome. The index of the
stop position for each gene is found using the left bound
from the start of the gene reducing the search space for
the stop position somewhat. This function differs from
boundingIndices in that 1. it uses both start and end
positions for the subject, and 2. query and subject start
and end positions are processed in blocks corresponding to
chromosomes. Both query and subject must be in at least weak
genome order (sorted by start within chromosome blocks).
