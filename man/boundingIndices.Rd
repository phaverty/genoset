\title{Find indices of features bounding a set of chromosome ranges/genes}
\usage{
boundingIndices(starts, stops, positions, all.indices = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{starts}{integer vector of first base position of
  each query range}

  \item{stops}{integer vector of last base position of each
  query range}

  \item{positions}{Base positions in which to search}

  \item{all.indices}{logical, return a list containing full
  sequence of indices for each query}
}
\value{
integer matrix of 2 columms for start and stop index of
range in data or a list of full sequences of indices for
each query (see all.indices argument)
}
\description{
This function is similar to findOverlaps but it guarantees
at least two features will be covered. This is useful in
the case of finding features corresponding to a set of
genes. Some genes will fall entirely between two features
and thus would not return any ranges with findOverlaps.
Specifically, this function will find the indices of the
features (first and last) bounding the ends of a range/gene
(start and stop) such that first <= start < stop <= last.
Equality is necessary so that multiple conversions between
indices and genomic positions will not expand with each
conversion. Ranges/genes that are outside the range of
feature positions will be given the indices of the
corresponding first or last index rather than 0 or n + 1 so
that genes can always be connected to some data.
}
\details{
This function uses some tricks from findIntervals, where is
for k queries and n features it is O(k * log(n)) generally
and ~O(k) for sorted queries. Therefore will be
dramatically faster for sets of query genes that are sorted
by start position within each chromosome. The index of the
stop position for each gene is found using the left bound
from the start of the gene reducing the search space for
the stop position somewhat. boundingIndices does not check
for NAs or unsorted data in the subject positions. These
assumptions are safe for position info coming from a
GenoSet or GRanges.
