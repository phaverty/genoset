\title{Average features in ranges per sample}
\usage{
rangeSampleMeans(query, subject, assay.element, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{query}{GRanges object representing genomic regions
  (genes) to be averaged.} \item{subject}{A GenoSet object
  or derivative} \item{assay.element}{character, name of
  element in assayData to use to extract data} \item{na.rm}
  {scalar logical, ignore NAs?}
}
\value{
numeric matrix of features in each range averaged by sample
}
\description{
This function takes per-feature genomic data and returns
averages for each of a set of genomic ranges. The most
obvious application is determining the copy number of a
set of genes. The features corresponding to each gene are
determined with boundingIndices such that all features with
the bounds of a gene (overlaps). The features on either side
of the gene unless those positions exactly match the first
or last base covered by the gene. Therefore, genes falling
between two features will at least cover two features. Range
bounding is performed by the boundingIndices function.
