\title{Calculate min/max/sum/mean/whichmin/whichmax over each view on each column of an RleDataFrame.}
\usage{
.do_rledf_views(x, bounds, na.rm = FALSE, simplify = TRUE, RLEFUN,
  FUN.TYPE = c("numeric", "double", "integer", "logical"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{RleDataFrame} \item{bounds}{IRanges or matrix,
  views on every Rle. If \code{bounds} is a matrix, it is
  converted to an IRanges using the first two columns as the
  starts and stops. Names for the IRanges are taken from the
  rownames of the matrix. Such a matrix can be constructed
  with \code{boundingIndicesByChr}.} \item{na.rm}{scalar
  logical, ignore NAs in calculations?} \item{simplify}
  {scalar logical, simplify result? For a single view,
  a vector, otherwise a matrix with one row per view.}
  \item{RLEFUN}{function, internal rle view summary function
  like .rle_view_means} \item{FUN.TYPE}{scalar character,
  the storage mode for the returned vector or matrix (when
  simplify==TRUE).}
}
\value{
With \code{simplify == TRUE}, a vector for single view or
a matrix otherwise. When \code{simplify == FALSE}, a list
of vectors length ncol(x) where each element is of length
\code{nrows(bounds)}.
}
\description{
Loop over the Rle objects in an RleDataFrame, calculate the
appropriate statistic for each view. If simplify == FALSE,
this function returns a vector for each Rle. If simplify
== TRUE, it returns a vector for the case of a single view,
otherwise, a matrix. Rownames for the matrix are taken from
the names of the argument \code{bounds}.
