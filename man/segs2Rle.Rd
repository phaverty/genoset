\title{Make Rle from segments for one sample}
\usage{
segs2Rle(segs, locs)
}
\arguments{
\item{segs}{data.frame of segments, formatted as output of segment function from DNAcopy package}

\item{locs}{GenomicRanges, like locData slot of a GenoSet}
}
\value{
Rle with run lengths and run values covering all features in the data set.
}
\description{
Take output of CBS, make Rle representing all features in 'locs' ranges. CBS output contains
run length and run values for genomic segmetns, which could very directly be converted into a Rle.
However, as NA values are often removed, especially for mBAF data, these run lengths do not
necessarily cover all features in every sample. Using the start and top positions of each segment
and the location of each feature, we can make a Rle that represents all features.
}
\examples{
  data(genoset)
  segs = runCBS( genoset.ds[, , "lrr"], locData(genoset.ds), return.segs=TRUE )
  segs2Rle( segs[[1]], locData(genoset.ds) )  # Take a data.frame of segments, say from DNAcopy's segment function, and make Rle's using probe locations in the locs
