\title{Calculate min/max/sum/mean/whichmin/whichmax over ranges on each column of an RleDataFrame.}
\usage{
.do_rledf_range_summary(x, bounds, na.rm = FALSE, simplify = TRUE, RLEFUN,
  FUN.TYPE = c("numeric", "double", "integer", "logical"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{RleDataFrame}

  \item{bounds}{IRanges or matrix, views on every Rle. If
  \code{bounds} is a matrix, the first two columns are used
  as as the starts and stops. Names for the ranges are
  taken from rownames of the matrix. Such a matrix can be
  constructed with \code{boundingIndicesByChr}.}

  \item{na.rm}{scalar logical, ignore NAs in calculations?}

  \item{simplify}{scalar logical, simplify result? For a
  single view, a vector, otherwise a matrix with one row
  per view.}

  \item{RLEFUN}{function, internal rle view summary
  function like .rle_range_means}

  \item{FUN.TYPE}{scalar character, the storage mode for
  the returned vector or matrix (when simplify==TRUE).}
}
\value{
With \code{simplify == TRUE}, a vector for single view or a
matrix otherwise. When \code{simplify == FALSE}, a list of
vectors length ncol(x) where each element is of length
\code{nrows(bounds)}.
}
\description{
Loop over the Rle objects in an RleDataFrame, calculate the
appropriate statistic for each view. If simplify == FALSE,
this function returns a vector for each Rle. If simplify ==
TRUE, it returns a vector for the case of a single range,
otherwise, a matrix. Rownames for the matrix are taken from
the names of the argument \code{bounds}.
