\title{Defunct genoset features}
\description{
The CNSet and BAFSet classes are defunct.  They only really added getter/setter methods for specific assayDataElements,
so they are now redundant with the preferred method of using the assayDataElement name as the third argument to bracket, e.g.
\code{x[i, j, "lrr"]}. Accordingly \code{BAFSet.to.ExpressionSets} is also defunct.
}
\details{
Additionally, names, ranges, and space on a GenoSet are also defunct. In an effort to make a consistent API for either RangedData or
GRanges in the locData slot, we recommend using \code{chrNames} for \code{names} and \code{chr} for \code{space}.
